Data for my first capstone project as part of Thinkful's Data Science Immersion Program.

Data obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/rohitsahoo/bicycle-store-dataset, posted on Kaggle under a GPL 2 license.

Performed tests of statistical significance to determine whether the profit earned from various types of bicycles was statistically significant. Regardless if it's deemed 'significant' via the test's results, it does not necessarily translate into 'significant' for a business' bottomline. Additional context and exploratory analysis needs to be conducted in order to descern whether this information warrants further investigation.

That is exactly what is on display throughout this project. With a signficant t-test on the profits earned from different bike product classes found in the used dataset, additional projects and context are needed to confirm whether the more profitable bike product lines ought to stocked more, or advertised to certain consumer segments.

This project will be updated over time to include further analysis such as unsupervised learning to better discern consumer segements, as well as other interesting projects driven from a business understanding and desire to maximize sales and marketing efficiency.
